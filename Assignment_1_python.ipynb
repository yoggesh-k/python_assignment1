    "# Ques3: Compare and contrast mutable and immutable objects in Python with examples\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " ''' Ans:  Python, objects can be categorized as either mutable or immutable:\n",
    " \n",
    " 1. Mutable: Mutable objects allow changes after creation.That means Mutable objects can be changed after they \n",
    "     are created.This means we can alter their state or contents without creating a new object.\n",
    " Common examples of mutable objects in Python include lists, dictionaries, sets, and most user-defined objects.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     Characteristics of Mutable Objects:\n",
    "     \n",
    "      1. Contents can change : The elements or attributes of the object can be modified.\n",
    "      2. Same memory location : When modified, the object retains its memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "      2. Immutable: Immutable objects cannot be changed after they are created.That means Immutable objects \n",
    "      cannot be changed after they are created. Any attempt to modify the object results in the creation of a\n",
    "      new object. Common examples of immutable objects in Python include integers, floats, strings, tuples.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Characteristics of Immutable Objects:\n",
    "    \n",
    "     1. Contents cannot change: Once created, the object's state or content cannot be altered.\n",
    "     2. New memory location: Modifying an immutable object results in the creation of a new object at different \n",
    "        memory address.\n",
    "\n",
    "     Comparison: (Mutable and Immutable Objects)\n",
    "     \n",
    "   1. Similarities:\n",
    "       Both types of objects are used to store data.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Both can be assigned to variables and passed to functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Differences:\n",
    "   \n",
    "       Modification:\n",
    "        Mutable objects can be modified in place without changing their memory address.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Immutable objects cannot be modified in place; any change results in a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3.Performance:\n",
    "       Mutable objects can be more efficient for operations that involve many changes, as they do not require\n",
    "       creating new objects.\n",
    "       \n",
    "       Immutable objects can be more efficient in some contexts due to their hashability, making them suitable\n",
    "       for use as dictionary keys or set elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4.Use Cases:\n",
    "        Mutable objects are often used when a data structure needs to be frequently updated, such as lists for\n",
    "        dynamic collections of items.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Immutable objects are often used for fixed data structures where safety from unintended changes is \n",
